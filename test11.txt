Had I the heavens embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and dim of the dark cloths
of night and light and the half-light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I being poor have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly, because you tread on my dreams
					William Butler Yeats

There are only two ways to live you life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.
